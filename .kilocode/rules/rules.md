# Madinah Project Rules

## Development Rules

### TypeScript Errors

- **Do not fix TypeScript errors when adding a lesson.** These errors may be intentional for educational purposes.
- TypeScript errors should be preserved during lesson additions to maintain the educational integrity of the content.
- This applies specifically to vocabulary items, grammar rules, and other lesson content where the errors might serve a pedagogical purpose.
