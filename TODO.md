# TODO: Convert to Next.js Application

## Initialize Next.js Project:

[ ] Set up a new Next.js application. Consider if you want to do this in the current directory or a new subdirectory (e.g., `my-next-app`).
[ ] Run `npx create-next-app@latest .` (if in current directory and it's empty or you've backed up `index.html` and `TODO.md`) or `npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app`.
[ ] Choose options during setup (e.g., TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS). **Recommended: Select Tailwind CSS during Next.js setup.**

## Project Setup & Basic Structure:

[ ] If you didn't select Tailwind CSS during `create-next-app`, install and configure it for Next.js: `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` then `npx tailwindcss init -p`. Configure `tailwind.config.js` and `globals.css`.
[ ] Create a `components` directory for reusable UI parts.
[ ] Create a `lib` or `utils` directory for helper functions or data.

## Migrate Core HTML Structure (Layout):

[ ] Create a `components/Layout.js` component.
[ ] Move the main HTML structure (body, overall div layout, sidebar, main content area placeholder) from `index.html` into `Layout.js`.
[ ] Convert HTML tags to JSX (e.g., `class` to `className`, `for` to `htmlFor`).
[ ] In `pages/_app.js`, import and use this `Layout` component to wrap `Component {...pageProps}`.

## Migrate CSS:

[ ] **Tailwind CSS**: Ensure Tailwind is configured correctly. Most of your utility classes from the CDN link will work.
[ ] **Custom CSS in `<style>` tags**:
[ ] Move the CSS rules from the `<style>` block in `index.html` into `styles/globals.css` (or a more specific CSS module if preferred for some parts).
[ ] Ensure font imports (`Inter`, `Noto Kufi Arabic`) are handled, likely in `globals.css` or `_app.js`. Next.js also has built-in font optimization (`next/font`).
[ ] Update any selectors if necessary due to JSX structure changes.

## Migrate Static Assets (Fonts):

[ ] The Google Fonts import can be moved to `pages/_document.js` (for `<link>` tags in `<Head>`) or imported in `styles/globals.css` using `@import`. Next.js also has built-in font optimization (`next/font`).
[ ] If you had local images/icons (none apparent in `index.html` but good to keep in mind), they would go into the `public` directory.

## Migrate JavaScript Logic & Data:

[ ] **`lessonsData` Array:**
[ ] Move the `lessonsData` array into a separate file, e.g., `lib/lessonsData.js` or `data/lessons.js`. Export it from there.
[ ] **Core Page (`pages/index.js`):**
[ ] This will be your main page. Import `lessonsData`.
[ ] Replicate the initial rendering of the lesson list and the main content area.
[ ] Use React state (`useState`) and effects (`useEffect`) to manage:
[ ] The currently selected lesson.
[ ] Displaying lesson content.
[ ] AI feature toggle state (consider React Context or a state management library for global state like this if it grows).
[ ] **Sidebar Navigation (`components/Sidebar.js`):**
[ ] Create a `Sidebar` component.
[ ] Port the JavaScript logic for populating `lessonListContainer` and handling lesson selection clicks.
[ ] Manage sidebar open/close state (for mobile) using React state.
[ ] **Modal (`components/GeminiModal.js`):**
[ ] Create a `GeminiModal` component.
[ ] Manage modal visibility and content using props and React state.
[ ] Port the `openGeminiModal`, `closeGeminiModal` logic.
[ ] **Markdown Conversion (`showdown.js`):**
[ ] Install Showdown: `npm install showdown`.
[ ] Import and use Showdown within components where Markdown rendering is needed (likely in the modal or where lesson rules are displayed if they were Markdown).
[ ] **API Calls (`callGeminiAPI` function):**
[ ] This logic will likely live within a component method or a custom hook.
[ ] **Security Note**: The API key should NOT be hardcoded in client-side JavaScript. Use Next.js API Routes (`pages/api`) to create a backend endpoint that makes the call to the Gemini API. The client-side code would then call your Next.js API route.
[ ] Migrate the `generateCacheKey`, `handleExplainFurther`, `handleGenerateExamples` functions.
[ ] Caching logic (`localStorage`) can remain similar but ensure it's only accessed on the client-side (e.g., within `useEffect`).
[ ] **AI Toggle Logic:**
[ ] Manage `aiFeaturesEnabled` state in React.
[ ] Port `updateAIToggleState` and `loadAITogglePreference` logic, adapting it to React state and `useEffect` for `localStorage` interaction.

## Create Dynamic Pages for Lessons (Optional but Recommended for SEO & Structure):

[ ] Instead of rendering all lesson content on one page via JavaScript, consider using dynamic routes, e.g., `pages/lessons/[lessonId].js`.
[ ] This would involve fetching or filtering `lessonsData` based on the `lessonId` from the route.

## Install Dependencies:

[ ] `npm install showdown tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` (if not already done).
[ ] Any other libraries you might decide to use (e.g., a state management library).

## Testing:

[ ] Run the development server: `npm run dev`.
[ ] Thoroughly test all functionalities:
[ ] Lesson selection and display.
[ ] Sidebar opening/closing on mobile.
[ ] AI feature toggle.
[ ] Modal opening/closing, loading state, and content display.
[ ] (Once API route is set up) AI feature calls.
[ ] Check for console errors and fix them.
[ ] Ensure styles are applied correctly.

## Build and Deploy (Later Stage):

[ ] Create a production build: `npm run build`.
[ ] Plan for deployment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).

## Cleanup:

[ ] Once the Next.js app is fully functional, remove the original `index.html` (if the Next.js app is in the same directory and replaces it).

## Update TODO.md (Post-Conversion):

[ ] Mark the main conversion task as complete in this file.

[ ] Add references to relevant commits or PRs for the conversion.
