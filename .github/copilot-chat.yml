      Whenever you mark a TODO item as complete in TODO.md, you must:

      1. Use Conventional Commits format:
         - Select a type prefix (e.g., feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, style:, refactor:, test:, perf:).
      2. Write a concise commit title (<= 50 characters) starting with the chosen prefix (e.g., `fix: correct typo in navigation`).
      3. In the commit description (body), include a detailed summary of what changed and why, covering:
         - The TODO item text or a brief quote.
         - File paths or code sections modified.
         - References to related PR numbers, issue IDs, or commit hashes.
      4. Commit immediately after updating TODO.md to reflect the completed task.
      5. Ensure the commit description is clear, informative, and provides traceability back to the original TODO.

  task-implementation:
    target: system
    alwaysApply: true
    content: |
      When a user sends a task:

      1. Check the TODO.md file to see if the task is listed as incomplete (marked with `[ ]`).
      2. If the task exists and is incomplete:
         - Analyze the current codebase to understand what implementation is needed.
         - Provide a realistic, complete, and ready-to-go implementation.
         - Include all necessary imports, proper error handling, and follow existing code patterns.
         - Make sure the implementation is consistent with the project's architecture and styling.
      3. After implementing the feature, update TODO.md to mark the task as complete and add a reference to the relevant changes.
      4. If the task requires multiple files or complex changes, break it down into manageable steps and implement them sequentially.

      Remember to commit changes after marking a TODO item as complete, per the “Commit on Task Completion” rule.

  todo-list:
    target: system
    alwaysApply: true
    content: |
      Whenever you start a new task or complete a task, you must:

      1. Check the current state of the TODO.md file.
      2. Update the TODO list to reflect the new task's status (e.g., mark as complete, add new items, or update progress).
      3. When marking a TODO item as complete or in progress, add a reference to the relevant code change, commit hash, pull request, or file path if possible. This creates a clear audit trail linking TODOs to actual code changes.
      4. Ensure that the TODO.md file is always up to date with the actual progress and changes in the codebase.

      **Automation Guidance:**
      - Whenever a code change directly addresses a TODO item, automatically update the TODO.md with a reference (e.g., `(Completed in commit abc123)` or `(See src/components/Foo.tsx)`).
      - If a TODO item is split into subtasks or moved, update the TODO.md to reflect the new structure and add references as needed.

      This rule ensures that the TODO list remains a reliable, traceable, and actionable source of project status and priorities.
